/*
This folder contains an example for 2D Action RPG.

IMPORTANT: You must run these steps to play the example:

 1. Import the package "Example Scenes" located in this folder. This will replace 
    2D Action RPG Starter Kit's example scenes located in 2dactionrpg/Scenes with
    Dialogue System-enabled versions. It will also update some 2D RPG scripts to
    allow for data exchange with the Dialogue System.
 2. Play this scene: 2dactionrpg/Scenes/loader.
 
 For further instructions, see the Integration page in the Dialogue System manual
(Window > Dialogue System > Help > Manual).
